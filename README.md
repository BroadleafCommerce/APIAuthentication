# Broadleaf API Authentication

This module should be used to provide authentication and security for an application using the Broadleaf API module. This module is built to be used with a stateless API for a single-page application. For an example of an application using this module for authentication, see [React Starter](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/ReactStarter).
